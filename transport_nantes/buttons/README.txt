This app will display 4 buttons on a page, labelled A, B, C and D. 

Each click on a button will increase its own counter. 
The servers has to print on terminal a message like "I've seen {letter} at {timestamp}" on each click. 
We also need to create a dict with the number of clicks on each button.

Ideally, the counter is displayed and updated by the server using Ajax. 

No models will be used, as no information will be kept either locally or on the server. 
A refresh should reset all counters to 0.
